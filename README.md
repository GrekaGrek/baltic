# Spring Boot task:
* RESTful service with endpoints for adding/updating/deleting users.
* In-memory storage is fine, but you can also store the data in a database or any other
  technology.
* Please create unit tests, at least for some functionality (either add/update/delete).
* Please use Java 17 / Spring Boot 3.x if possible


# FYI
 * For data storage is used Postgres with Docker 

Please first check Docker availability on your machine (e.g. Docker Desktop).
Run docker compose build/up commands before app local run.

* For endpoints check/tests can use [Swagger UI](localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#)
